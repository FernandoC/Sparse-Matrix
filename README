Description: Reads in an input file parses it and turns information
             into two matrices. The matrix is essentially an array of doubly
             LinkedLists. Sparce.java then procedes to add, subtact, multiply
             them to each other. The program can also transpose matrices or
             apply a scalar multiplication. It then prints these results to
             an out file.

Compiling Instructions: Download all the files and type "make" in SSH

Files Submitted: List.java, ListTest.java, Sparce.java, Matrix.java, MatrixTest.java, Makefile, and README

List.java:       Contains the doubly linked List ADT and all its functions.

ListTest.java:   Contains a program that uses the List ADT to make sure everything
                 is in order by calling all of its functions.

Sparce.java:     Reads in a file and creates Matrix A and B.
                 The matrix is essentially an array of doubly LinkedLists. 
                 Sparce.java then procedes to add, subtact, multiply

MatrixTest.java: Contains a program that uses the Matrix ADT to make sure everything
                 is in order by calling all of its functions.

Makefile:        Compiles everything and makes the Sparce program into a jar file.

README:          The title serves its purpose.
